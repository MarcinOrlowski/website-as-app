# WebApp

Run any website as standalone desktop application

---

This Python script offers a unique approach to web browsing by opening any webpage in a dedicated
window using the embedded QT WebEngine. By removing the typical browser UI elements, it effectively
turns websites into standalone desktop applications. This can be particularly useful if you've ever
wished to run a frequently used website as a separate app, independent from your main browser.

The tool provides a practical solution for those who find themselves juggling numerous browser tabs
or wanting a clearer separation between work and personal web applications. With each website
running as its own "app", you gain the benefit of individual entries in your window manager or task
switcher, potentially improving your workflow organization and efficiency.

Whether you're looking to streamline your digital workspace or simply curious about alternative
ways to interact with web content, this script presents an interesting concept that might just
solve a problem you didn't know you had.

**IMPORTANT:** It's worth pointing out however, that this tool doesn't transform websites into
offline applications. Rather, it focuses on separating your key websites from each other and from
the multitude of browser tabs you might typically have open. While this approach offers improved
organization and workflow, it's crucial to understand that an internet connection is still required
for these "apps" (websites) to function as they normally would in a traditional browser environment.
