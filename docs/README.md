# WebApp

Run any website as standalone desktop application

---

Small Python script opening any web page in dedicated window, using embedded QT WebEngine. There are
no visible browser's UI etc., so the that can be useful to turn any website into standalone desktop
application. This is useful if you, as me, would like to have a website run as standalone app,
independently of your main browser which can be beneficial as it gives you separate entry in
window manager or task switcher etc.

> **IMPORTANT:** This tool is **NOT** turning websites into OFFLINE apps! It's about separating 
> each of your key websites i.e. from each other, or gazzilions of your browser's tabs. But you
> still MUST be connected to the Internet for the apps (websites) to work as previously.
